# Please-readMe

Challenge 9: README Generator

## Description:

This repository helps users generate a read me inside their terminal using [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

## How Things Work

First, the user must run main file inside the Intergrated Terminal.

Then, they will be asked a number of questions.

After the user is finished with answering all the questions, a README.md file will be created with the information received.

Here is a walk-through video of all the steps you will need to do to generate a README.md [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S77ZNZUFDHe_C6irsOPBIj1vt44ja4R5/view)
