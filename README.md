##Description:
This repository helps users generate a read me inside their terminal using [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

##How Things Work

Then, they will be asked a number of questions.

After the user is finished with answering all the questions, a README.md file will be created with the information received.
